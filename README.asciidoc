SeenIt

__Knows what you've seen so you don't have to.__

There are currently two implementations of the __seenit__ suite:

The __seenit__ Bourne Shell suite provides the following scripts:

* ++seeit file++       :: Add ++file++ to seen list and watch it now
* ++seen pattern++     :: Show last time a file matching ++pattern++ was seen
* ++seenit file-list++ :: Adds each file in ++file-list++ to the seen list
* ++unseen [pattern]++ :: Show unseen files, optionally matching ++pattern++

The __vid.fish__ Fish Shell script has the following commands:

* ++see file++         :: Adds file to the .seenit file and shows it.
* ++seen [pattern]++   :: Shows the seen files, optionally matching /pattern/.
* ++seenit file-list++ :: Adds file-list to the .seenit file.
* ++unseen [pattern]++ :: Shows unseen files, optionally matching /pattern/.
* ++help [command]++   :: Shows all help, or optionally for command only.
